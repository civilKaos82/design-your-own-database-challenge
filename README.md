##Releases
###Release 0 : Build your Database

Come up with your own example of a cool database.  Is it a database that holds characters and objects in a video game?  Or the relationships of Super PACS with members of Congress and their parties?  What are you interested in that's associated with lots of data, and create a model to hold all the attributes and relationships within that data.   Model it in [SQL Designer](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/sql.html). Turn in your XML of the schema, a link to a screen shot of the tables, and a brief description of the data and relationships in the source file `design_your_own.md` .
