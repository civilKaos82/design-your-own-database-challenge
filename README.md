# Design Your Own Database 
 
##Learning Competencies 

##Summary 

 Get even more creative and design your own database, complete with multiple many-to-many and one-to-many relationships on your own (i.e. not with your pair) and build it in [SQL Designer](/sql.html).


## Objectives

### Build your Database

Come up with your own example of a cool database.  Is it a database that holds characters and objects in a video game?  Or the relationships of Super PACS with members of Congress and their parties?  What are you interested in that's associated with lots of data, and create a model to hold all the attributes and relationships within that data.   Model it in [SQL Designer](/sql.html).
